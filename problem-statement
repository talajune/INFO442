Violence against women is a problem that exists and persists across the world. Current interventions have not been successful globally in aiding women to get support against violence. According to the United Nations, Fewer than 40 percent of the women who experience violence seek help of any sort (Violence Against Women, 2021). There should be an accessible, online, safe space where women can come to to get support and advice. Adittoinaly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, calls to helplines have increased five-fold in some countries which can be attributed to restricted movement, social isolation, and economic insecurity (UN Women, 2021). When women experience violence by partners or family, it can be hard for them to seek help from the police, therapists, or medically. There must be a product that exists that can offer guidance for the next steps for impacted women, support groups, and resources, all for free and accessible through the website. So, a woman can access help without having to leave her home. They should be able to communicate with police and authorities without having to make a call or go into a station in person.
